# eatherTune - Current Location Weather

## APIs
* [Ipinfo](https://ipinfo.io/) to gather current location
* [Openweathermap](http://openweathermap.org/) for weather updates
  * A plus of using openweather is the includsion of changing weather icons.

Bulk of code is Javascript in Sinatra with the hopes of adding future content.

Future Plans:
* Add dynamic backgrounds to match current weather
* Experiment with Spotify API integration to include a current weather playlist.
* Experiment with AWS Product Catalog API to recommend items based on weather/location
